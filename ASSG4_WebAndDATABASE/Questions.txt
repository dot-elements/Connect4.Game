1.2) Ìt's almost the same.
1.3) The Transfer-Encoding header specifies the form of encoding used to safely transfer the payload body to the user.
1.4)cache-control: no-store:
			The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.
		   no-cache:
			Caches must check with the origin server for validation before using the cached copy.
		   must-revalidate:
			Indicates that once a resource becomes stale, caches must not use their stale copy without successful validation on the origin server.
		   If both post-check and pre-check are specified and set to 0, both are entirely ignored.
2.1)If it's smaller it's going to drop charaters from the String
    If it's bigger it's going to expect more characters and it's going to wait even though you pressed enter after the string.
3.1) for future HTTP requests the browser automatically sends along the stored username/password.It doesn't wait for another request.
3.2) You recieve 401 UNAUTHORIZED
